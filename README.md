**ReactJS skeleton App**

A skeleton structure for ReactJS development

Included dependencies

Dependencies saved locally to `package.json`

* react
* react-dom
* babelify
* watchify
* babel-preset-react

**Usage**

You need Browserify globally installed:

`$ npm i -g browserify`

Open the project root directory and run:

`$ npm install`

**Start script**

The `package.json` contains the default start script:

`watchify src/main.jsx -v -t [ babelify --presets [ react ] ] -o public/js/main.js`
where `src/main.jsx `is your main entry point and `public/js/main.js` is the output bundle js file.

**Run**

`npm run`
will run the browserify bundler and keep running in watch mode in the background. It will detect any code changes (on file save) and automatically re-bundle the files.

**Other**

`.gitignore` by default contains the following

`node_modules/`

`.idea/`
